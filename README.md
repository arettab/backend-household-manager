# Household Manager (Backend)
The Household Manager (Backend) is a Flask application designed to simplify household management by allowing the creation of household groups with a parent as the head of the household. Household members can use the app to update their schedules, and the head of the household has access to everyone's schedules in one location, making it easy to manage the household's activities.

## Features
- Household Creation: Create a household group with a designated parent as the head of the household.
User Management: Add and manage household members within the app.
- Scheduling: Household members can update their schedules, including events, appointments, and activities.
- Schedule Conflict Resolution: The app checks for scheduling conflicts within the household. An event can be rejected if it conflicts with someone else's schedule.
- Grounding System: The app allows the head of the household to set grounding rules. If a household member is grounded, they won't be able to add or modify their schedule until the grounding is lifted.
